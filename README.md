## ⭐ Service Gap Analysis

Service gap analysis compares satisfaction vs dissatisfaction across key service touchpoints.

### Overall Service Gap Drivers (All Passengers)

- Online boarding experience → **1.4**  
- Inflight entertainment → **1.1**  
- Seat comfort → **0.9**  
- WiFi connectivity → **0.8**  
- Cleanliness → **0.8**  
- Onboard service → **0.8**  
- Food and drinks → **0.6**  
- Baggage handling → **0.6**  
- Check-in experience → **0.6**

**Interpretation:** Digital convenience and cabin comfort are the strongest determinants of satisfaction for the overall passenger population.

### Segment-Level Insight (Ages 45–54 and 55+)

When filtering older passengers, service priorities shift:

- **Leg room comfort → 1.3**  
- **Inflight entertainment → 1.2**  
- **Online boarding experience → 1.1**

**Behavioral Insight:** Older passengers prioritize **physical comfort and in-flight experience** over digital convenience. This indicates that service design should be **segment-specific**, not one-size-fits-all.

## ✈️ Operational Performance Analysis

### Departure Delay vs Satisfaction

Passenger satisfaction declines as delay duration increases, particularly for short and medium haul flights.

| Delay Duration | Long Haul | Medium Haul | Short Haul |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0–5 minutes | 71.6% | 42.9% | 35.9% |
| 6–15 minutes | 69.0% | 40.5% | 30.6% |
| 16–30 minutes | 65.7% | 37.1% | 26.5% |
| 31–60 minutes | 64.0% | 34.3% | 25.8% |
| 60+ minutes | 62.6% | 33.4% | 26.2% |

**Insight:** Short-haul passengers are highly sensitive to delays, emphasizing the need for operational efficiency and communication during disruptions.
